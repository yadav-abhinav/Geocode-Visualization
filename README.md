# Geocode-Visualization

##Visualisation of Geocode data using Python automated scripts and a map tool provided by www.pythonlearn.com.

##Working of the entire project:
1. We will enter the list of locations that we want to visaulize in locations.data file.
2. Then we will run locLoad.py script.
    1. locLoad.py will fetch the geocode data using the Google Geocoding API.
    2. This will be done for all the locations mentioned in the locations.data file.
    3. The data fetched by locLoad.py for Geocoding API will be in JSON format.
    4. All these data will be stored in a sqlite database.
3. Now we will run locDump.py script.
    1. locDump.py will read the sqlite database generated by locLoad.py.
    2. This script will generate locations.js file containing latitude, longitude and formatted address of each location in the   locations.data file in the form of list of list names 'myData'.
4. Finally locations.js file will be used by locations.html file containing the tool by www.pythonlearn.com to visualize the locations on the world map.
